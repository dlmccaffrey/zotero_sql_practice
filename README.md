# zotero_sql_practice
Practicing SQL by using my zotero library, which is stored as a SQLite database.

There were several journals which appeared frequently in my citations, but not in my RSS feed, so I added those journals. There are also several research groups that I should be following that were unfamiliar to me.

Unfortunately, the database is too large, so I cannot store it on GitHub.
